\begin{itemize}
\item Understanding how agricultural intensification shapes pollinator health can improve conservation measures.
\item Landscape simplification reduced bumble bee species richness and abundance of native but not introduced species.
\item Abundance of an invasive bumble bee shaped community-wide parasite prevalence but landscape characteristics did not.
\item Parasite species respond differently to ecological drivers; understanding why could improve our ability to predict pollinator disease outbreaks.
\end{itemize}
